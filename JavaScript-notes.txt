Variables:
  Variable names can't be:
    1. Special words.
    2. Can't start with words.
    3. Can't use special characters except _ (underscore) and $ (dollar).
  Ways to create a Variable:
    let
      let variable_name = anything;
      can't be changed later, and harder to find the meaning cuz it keeps changing.
    const
      const variable_name = anything;
      can't be changed later, i.e. will be constant.
